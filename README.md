How to memorize vocabulary when you learn a language 

## Why ? 💡
- I'm a student in computing, and I noticed that my English isn't good ...
- Indeed, in my learning, i'm slow because there are several words in English that i type in Google Transate but i forget him later.

## Solution 📖
- Why not use a program to improve my english ?
- Of course ! I know programming, so i create a personal interface to memorize some words in English.

## How work ? 💻
- I use a .csv file to store my data of the words i don't know when i read some text in english in my studies. 
- So, a main.py file read data.csv and show in the terminal a pretty interface (indeed i use rich package in python)
- When i load the program, it show me a random word in data.csv and i must to guess the translate french > english or english > french. 

## Enjoy ! 🏃
- You can use my body of code and customize it.
- I should you to create your personal data.csv when you don't know a word and think it can be useful to write in.
- Furthermore, you may customize the language
